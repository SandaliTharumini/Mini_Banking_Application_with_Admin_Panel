This project demonstrates how distributed SQL databases can be applied in real-world financial scenarios such as the banking industry. It has been developed using CockroachDB, Python, and a Tkinter-based graphical interface.
The application consists of two main components:
1. Bank Customer End
   
•	Clients can create new accounts and make initial deposits.

•	Supports fund transfers between accounts.

•	Provides real-time account balance retrieval.

•	Displays detailed transaction history for each account.

2. Admin Panel
   
The Admin Panel provides comprehensive oversight of the banking system. Key features include:

•	Monitoring of all user accounts with full visibility of balances.

•	Tracking and reviewing transaction histories across the platform.

•	Advanced filtering capabilities for both accounts and transactions.

•	Access to system statistics and performance indicators.

•	An intuitive tabbed interface for efficient navigation and management of the financial ecosystem.

Note:

This is a demo project. More advanced banking features such as security measures, authentication, encryption, fraud detection, and regulatory compliance have not yet been implemented. The focus of this project is to showcase the practical use of distributed SQL (CockroachDB) in managing a simulated banking workflow.
